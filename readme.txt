2. Experiment_2.ipynb
3. Experiment_3.ipynb
4. Experiment_4.ipynb
5. Experiment_5.ipynb
6. Experiment_6.ipynb
7. Experiment_7.ipynb

Helper Files:
1. architecture1_cnn.py
2. architecture2_cnn.py
3. baseline_cnn.py
4. xray_dataloader.py

======================================
What Each File Does:
* Each Python Notebook corresponds to the respective experiment. Running all the cells in an experiment 
  will train the network, output loss and accuracy curves, output convolutional layer visualizations, 
  test the network, output precision, recall, and BCR statistics, and print the confusion matrix.  
* The xray_dataloaer.py loads in the training data and makes partitions
* There are 3 neural network architectures that define the architecture of each of the networks we tested:
  these architectures are defined in the helper files, which are imported in each experiment.
